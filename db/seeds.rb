# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# pizza = Pizza.new(style: "deep dish", size: "small", topping: "sausage", price: 18)
# pizza.save

# pizza = Pizza.new(style: "stadium", size: "medium", topping: "pepperoni", price: 20)
# pizza.save

# pizza = Pizza.new(style: "thin", size: "large", topping: "bacon", price: 23)
# pizza.save
